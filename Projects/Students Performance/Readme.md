# Analysis on Student’s Performance :Students of The US
      
      
### What is Project about?
        This EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) is a journey through education, data visualization and exploratory data analysis of students Exam Scores at a public school to gain maximum insights on the test preparation course using Python libraries. EDA is a process of exploring data for analysis purpose. The steps involved in EDA are:

* Preparing the Data: know the dataset, produce all details.
* Cleaning the data for analysis: detect outliers and anomalies if any 
* Extract important variables from the data set, statistics of the data 
* Visualizations of data : this can be done in any step as per requirement 
* conclusion of analysis


### Data Provider:
Data is provided by the **kaggle** website under **Students Performance Data set** which gives the details of **Marks secured by the students in high school , Students from the United States**.
Data contains information about a student’s test preparation course with their 
* math score 
* reading score 
* writing score 
* parent’s education 
* lunch

### Purpose:
"Student performance data set" is collected to gain on insight into 
1.	How effective is the test preparation course?
2.	Which major factors contribute to test outcomes?
3.	What would be the best way to improve student scores on each test?
4.	To understand the influence of parents background on students’ performance
5.	To understand whether math’s score is related to writing and reading score
6.	To extract more closer details about the student such as percentage to know the pass and fail details.

### Softwares used:
* JUPYTER NOTEBOOK 
* EXCEL

### Libraries used:
* PANDAS
* NUMPY
* SEABORN
* MATPLOTLIB

### Conclusion:
* Test preparation course gives the result depending upon the race/ethnicity they are in and even the number of students in each group differs.
* Reading writing and math scores are correlated so to improve the scores students should make a habit of reading and writing to increase their skill 
* In general, scores taken by males and females do not differ by completion rate and pass rate.
* Lastly, Parents education has no effect on their children which was actually a surprising fact
