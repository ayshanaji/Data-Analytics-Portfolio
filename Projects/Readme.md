### Contents 

* **Students Performance-EDA** - This directory contains the dataset and EDA done during my training in EduBridge.
* **Samsung TV prices** - Webscrapping techniques are applied to get the data of prices and rating from Flipkart 
                        - Done during the training in EduBridge
* **SMS Spam Detection** - This directory contains the dataset of **SMS spam detection** provided by Kaggle and applied the Machine learning tool based on **Naives                                  Bayes-Multinomial** to Predict the spam in the message
* **Lung Cancer Prediction-ML Approach** - This directory contains predcition of lung cancer among certain age people using the data set from Kaggle.
                                         - Certain ML approaches are aplied to check who can be the best fit for the prediction
